## Applying the YOLO v5 on the Pascal VOC 2007 Dataset
The implementation of the YOLO v5 object detection model using boudning boxes on the Pascal VOC 2007 dataset. The Pascal VOC 2007 dataset is a well-known dataset for object detection, containing a variety of images annotated with object bounding boxes.

## The dataset contains 20 unique classes distributed, categorized into 4 main classes as follows:
Person: person \n
Animal: bird, cat, cow, dog, horse, sheep
Vehicle: aeroplane, bicycle, boat, bus, car, motorbike, train
